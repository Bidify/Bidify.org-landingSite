## Current User Flow Analysis

### Existing Flow Issues
- **Unclear Value Proposition**: Hero section doesn't immediately communicate benefits
- **Information Overload**: Too much content without clear progression
- **Weak CTAs**: Multiple call-to-action buttons without clear hierarchy
- **No Clear Path**: Users don't understand the next steps to become a partner
- **Passive Engagement**: Limited interactive elements to guide user journey

## Redesigned User Flow Strategy

## Navigation Improvements

### 1. Internal Page Navigation

- **Support Resources**: Links to Discord, documentation, and partner portal

### 3. Mobile Navigation

- **Simplified Flow**: Vertical progression optimized for single-thumb navigation
- **Sticky CTAs**: Primary CTA becomes sticky on mobile after scrolling

## User Flow Optimization Techniques

### 1. Visual Hierarchy
- **F-Pattern Layout**: Content arranged to follow natural eye movement
- **Color Psychology**: Strategic use of brand colors to draw attention to CTAs
- **Whitespace**: Ample spacing to reduce cognitive load and improve focus

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- **Information Chunking**: Content broken into digestible sections
- **Reveal Patterns**: Additional information revealed as user progresses
- **Contextual CTAs**: Relevant actions appear based on user position in journey

### 3. Conversion Optimization
- **Single Primary CTA**: Clear primary action in each section
- **Reduced Friction**: Minimal form fields and steps to conversion
- **Social Proof**: Partnership benefits demonstrate platform credibility
- **Risk Reduction**: Transparent fee structure builds trust

## Accessibility and Inclusive Navigation

### 1. Keyboard Navigation
- **Logical Tab Order**: Tab sequence follows visual layout
- **Skip Links**: "Skip to main content" for keyboard users
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus states for all interactive elements

### 2. Screen Reader Support
- **ARIA Labels**: Appropriate ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- **Landmark Roles**: Proper sectioning with semantic HTML5 elements
- **Live Regions**: Calculator results announced to screen readers

### 3. Cognitive Considerations
- **Clear Language**: Simple, jargon-free copy
- **Consistent Patterns**: Familiar UI patterns and interactions
- **Error Prevention**: Clear guidance to prevent user mistakes

## Performance and Technical Considerations

### 1. Page Load Optimization
- **Above-the-Fold Priority**: Critical content and CTAs load first
- **Lazy Loading**: Non-critical images and animations load on demand
- **Code Splitting**: Interactive components loaded only when needed

### 2. Navigation Performance
- **Instant Feedback**: Button clicks provide immediate visual feedback
- **Smooth Transitions**: All navigation transitions are buttery smooth
- **Preloading**: Key destination pages preloaded when possible

### 3. Analytics and Tracking
- **Conversion Tracking**: Key user actions tracked for optimization
- **Scroll Depth**: User engagement measured by scroll depth
- **Click Tracking**: CTA performance monitored for continuous improvement

## Implementation Plan

### 1. HTML Structure
- **Semantic Markup**: Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- **ARIA Landmarks**: Main, section, and navigation landmarks
- **Link Attributes**: Proper `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for external links

### 2. CSS Implementation
- **Smooth Scroll**: `scroll-behavior: smooth` on html element
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus styles for all interactive elements
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations

### 3. JavaScript Enhancements
- **Intersection Observer**: For scroll-triggered animations and tracking
- **Smooth Scroll Polyfill**: For browsers that don't support native smooth scroll
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation for calculator inputs
